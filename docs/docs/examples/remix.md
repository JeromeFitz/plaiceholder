# Remix

:::info

1. Some Remix deployment targets don't support plaiceholder (specifically, the `sharp` dependency)

   For most cases, we recommend using Vercel (which this example uses)

2. Remix doesn't encourage developers to access `public` files – _feel free to correct me on this_ – so only **remote images** are supported in this example

   _(which means no `@plaiceholder/tailwindcss`)_

:::

Includes Base64, Blurhash, CSS, SVG and Tailwind implementations.
